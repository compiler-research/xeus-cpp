Using xeus-cpp
---------------------

- With xeus-cpp, you can write and execute C++ code interactively, seeing
  the results immediately. This REPL nature allows you to iterate quickly
  without the overhead of compiling and running separate C++ programs.

- To achieve C++ and Python integration within a Jupyter environment we can use
  xeus-cpp. Thereby you can write and execute C++ code interactively in
  this environment.
